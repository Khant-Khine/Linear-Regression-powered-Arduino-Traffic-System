# Linear-Regression-powered-Arduino-Traffic-System
This project aims to help reduce the number of traffic intersection accidents, through discouraging drivers from attempting last minute crossings at the yellow light. This project is split into three components:
<ol>
<li>
Training Data
</li>
<li>
Software
</li>
<li>
Hardware
</li>
</ol>
The training data will be filled with information on what constitutes a dangerous speed at the last moments of the yellow light. This data will be analyzed through linear regression to return a decision on an action to be carried out.
